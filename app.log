He walked through the streets of a place that seemed like Delhi. But there it was — the Gateway of India
standing tall where India Gate should be. Confused, Sachin kept exploring.
He realized he had landed in a parallel world, where famous landmarks existed, but they were in the wrong
cities.
Each city had been swapped with the identity of another, and now it was up to Sachin — and you — to make

🧠 Mission Brief — Sachin's Parallel World
Discovery
"The flights are live, but the codes are scrambled. It's time to explore, understand, and fly."

— HackRx Core Team
🌍 The Strange New World
Sachin, one of the core members of HackRx, woke up in a strange version of Earth. Everything looked familiar
— the air, the people, the languages — but something was… off.
He walked through the streets of a place that seemed like Delhi. But there it was — the Gateway of India
standing tall where India Gate should be. Confused, Sachin kept exploring.
He realized he had landed in a parallel world, where famous landmarks existed, but they were in the wrong
cities.
Each city had been swapped with the identity of another, and now it was up to Sachin — and you — to make
sense of this twisted map.
Your goal: Find the flight number which takes him the real world
